* We set the environment (user provided)
* Set initial state and capabilities (user provided)
* Based on the environment, model sets survival requirements, policies, and rules.
* Based on provided initial components and capabilities, model sets rules, mechanisms, and policies.
* Define goals. This will be used by the model to asses our decisions from here. (User provided)
* Based on events, decisions, goals, current state, the model evolves and new factor arise or they get modified. It tires to change policies and self adapt, correct based on feedback from goal assessment and survival rate.
* The system will have to adjust as time passes.
* Will have to keep track of all states.
* Based on adaptation, new rules and mechanisms and policies will rise. But also new factors that survival rate and state of the goals will rely on.
