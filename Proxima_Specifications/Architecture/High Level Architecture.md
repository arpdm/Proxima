## Shape

* Multifaceted polygon with each edge symbolizing an aspect of the system.
* Within this polygon, spheres representing the world system are intricately interconnected, each sphere comprising smaller, segmented spheres. While all these spheres and subspheres maintain connections, the strength and impact of these connections vary, illustrating the complex interdependencies within the global system.
* it possesses the adaptive ability to reshape itself in response to new information or changing conditions.
* This flexibility ensures that the structure can keep up with dynamic, moving landscapes, never becoming too rigid or fixed.
