# Ideas on Growth Policies

1. Lifetime expiration
2. Science production rate increase
3. Slow down resource deplition rate.
4. Static Buffer based servicing and expansion = Limit on all queues. Create queue fullness assessment.
5. Power deficit profile based on expansion.


## Expansion triggers

When adding capabilities, dont just give more power generation. Rules can be added, so the system can grow based on advancement needs or worldy events.

- Advancement
- Adding cpabilities
- Trying to advance to the next phase as fast as possible. Keeping velocity hight. Regulations and goals bring it down. They regulated advancement velocity.
- Human Growth
- Monetary needs to perform tasts
- Low material stock compraed to goals


## Expansion Rules

- Each zone has a growth limit (maybe based on entropy index). If a zone reaches the entropy index, another zone must be created. No central governence. Zones can regulate eachother.

## Expansion Policy 001

1. The policy engine decides to double the science generation rate
2. To meet the rate, new science rovers are requested from the construction sector.
3. Creation of rovers requires more enegry.
4. Energy deficit profile causes growth of energy sector.
