# Model Improvements

1. Create a globall definition file that includes master definitions such as sector names. []
2. Create a base sector class so all sectors follow the same patthern. []
3. Make sure the power consumption is valid and causes demand to energey sector for each sector []
4. Move power allocation code to the energy sector instead of having it in the world system []
5. Add documentation separately for each sector and link to the architecture []
6. Extract sector dynamic equations and map them to world system definitions []
7. Document equations for manufacturing, and fuel generation sectors []
8. Make the policy configurations parameteric in the database []
9. Add policy description for Industrial Dust Coverage []
10. Pull energy_microgrid code to energy sector []
11. Use the config classes in energy_microgrid Code []
12. Document Fuel Generator Equations []
13. Document ISRU Equations []
14. Document Instructions on updating  or creating new components []
15. Use ENUMS for Event Engine Events
16. Document Rocket Equeations
17. For equipment manufacturing sector find a way to add more sophisticated policy for prioritizing orders
