1. Create a globall definition file that includes master definitions such as sector names. []
2. Create a base sector class so all sectors follow the same patthern. []
3. Make sure the power consumption is valid and causes demand to energey sector for each sector []
4. Move power allocation code to the energy sector instead of having it in the world system []
5. Add documentation separately for each sector and link to the architecture []
6. Extract sector dynamic equations and map them to world system definitions
7. Document equations for manufacturing, and fuel generation sectors
